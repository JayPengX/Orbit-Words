// ---- sync.js ----
// Optional cross-device sync for this app's learning progress (the
// progressStore app.js already keeps in localStorage). Reuses the shared
// Cloudflare Worker (see the separate JayPengX/shared-proxy repo's
// worker.js, its `/vocab-sync` path) as shared server-side infrastructure -
// this app has no server of its own, and piggybacking on an already-
// deployed Worker means its owner doesn't need a second Firebase project or
// a second thing to keep patched just for this. See shared-proxy's README
// for what runs server-side.
//
// Unlike Orbit's own schedule sync (one shared document broadcast from a
// manager device to many read-only viewer devices), this app's sync has no
// such broadcast use case: a pairing always belongs to ONE learner syncing
// their own progress across their own devices, so there is only ever one
// role. There's also nothing here for a separate, less-sensitive "public
// code" to protect the way Orbit's own sync code does - every operation on
// this app's sync (including plain reads) already needs the real secret
// (see the Worker's VOCAB_SYNC_APP), so a second identifier alongside it
// would just be one more string to type, copy, and lose, for no extra
// security. A single, longer passcode (see PASSCODE_KEY) is both this
// pairing's identifier and its only credential - the Worker derives its own
// server-side lookup key from it (see shared-proxy's worker.js), never
// storing or exposing anything the passcode itself doesn't already prove
// you know.
//
// Loaded as a plain <script> (attaches everything to `window.VocabSync`),
// same as logic.js/app.js - no bundler here, so the proxy URL below is a
// placeholder substituted at deploy time by .github/workflows/pages.yml,
// the same sed-based mechanism that already stamps __BUILD_VERSION__ into
// index.html/app.js. Left as the literal placeholder (or empty, if the
// GitHub Actions variable behind it is unset) when running locally without
// that build step - see isSyncProxyConfigured() below.
//
// PROXY_URL is just the Worker's base URL (e.g.
// https://orbit-workers-proxy.<you>.workers.dev, no path) - the same single
// variable also used by Orbit's own app for its /gemini, /nl-edit and /sync

/* ---------- Compact wire format for progress ----------
   Firestore/Workers KV quota is finite and shared by every device that
   ever syncs, across every learner using this app - a wasteful format
   here isn't just an optimization, it's spending someone else's (the
   deployer's) free-tier budget faster than it needs to. gzip (see above)
   already erases most of the cost of repeating the same field NAMES
   thousands of times, but it can't erase data that's genuinely redundant
   or genuinely never read back - only removing that helps further. Per
   attempted word, the plain localStorage shape (see logic.js's
   createEmptyWordHistory) carries several fields that fall into exactly
   that bucket:

     - `word`, `level`, `length` are dropped entirely - the map's own key
       IS the word (lowercased), and VOCAB_INDEX already has word/level for
       every real vocab entry, so migrateProgressStore recovers both on
       the receiving device exactly as it already does for legacy imports
       missing the same fields.
     - `incorrect` is dropped - always exactly `attempts - correct` (every
       recorded attempt increments exactly one of the two, alongside
       `attempts` itself - see logic.js's recordAttempt), so storing it is
       pure duplication.
     - `firstSeen` and `recentResponseMs` are dropped - grepping this repo
       confirms neither is read by any app.js render path or logic.js
       computation today. Reconstructed on decode anyway (firstSeen falls
       back to lastSeen, recentResponseMs to the newest kept
       recentAttempts entry's own responseMs - which, since that array
       always keeps the MOST RECENT attempts, is not a guess but the exact
       original value) so a synced entry still looks completely normal to
       anything that starts reading these fields later.
     - `box`/`due`/`inWrongList` are dropped - dead fields kept in the
       local shape only so migrating a genuinely ancient v1 backup doesn't
       choke; a synced entry is never that.
     - `lastResult` becomes a 1-digit code instead of the string
       "correct"/"incorrect".
     - `lastSeen` (and each recentAttempts entry's `timestamp`) becomes an
       integer number of SECONDS before the snapshot's own `exportedAt`,
       instead of an absolute millisecond Unix timestamp - shorter to
       write out, and for anything practiced recently (the common case for
       data worth syncing in the first place) a much smaller number to
       begin with.
     - `avgCorrectResponseMs` is rounded to the nearest millisecond -
       logic.js's EMA smoothing otherwise leaves a long, effectively
       random (so gzip can't help) decimal tail on almost every word.
     - Every remaining field is written as a fixed-position ARRAY element
       instead of a `{"key": value}` pair, so the field name itself is
       never written out at all, and recentAttempts is capped to
       RECENT_ATTEMPTS_SYNC_CAP entries with each entry its own compact
       tuple (`attemptNumber` dropped - confirmed unread outside this
       file's own tests).

   None of this touches the LOCAL copy kept in localStorage - only what
   gets written into the snapshot before compression. compactProgressForSync
   runs right before encodeSyncPayload; expandSyncedProgress runs right
   after decodeSyncPayload, turning a pulled snapshot back into the exact
   shape window.VocabState.applySyncedSnapshot already expects (the same
   shape Logic.migrateProgressStore itself understands), so nothing
   downstream of that has to know this compact format exists. */

// progress from before the reload would have that blind pull silently
// discard it. Treating "not yet synced this session" the same as `dirty` -
// both route through the guarded pushSnapshot() below - fixes both: its
// own totalAttempts comparison (see that function and

// totalAttempts guard already refuses to ever push something behind it -
// see that function's comment), but it's a confusing, easily-missed
// surprise for the USER: the import would appear to succeed, then get
// silently reverted a few seconds later the moment the next sync tick
// pulls the (further-along) server data back down - the exact same
// "silently undoes itself" trap unlinkAfterReset's own comment already
